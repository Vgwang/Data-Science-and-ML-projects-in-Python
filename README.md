# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects

Below are the descriptions of each project and what I have done in each project.  Feel free to take a look around!

## Coursera:

**Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems Projects:**
- Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
- Used collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for recommending movies based on past ratings and data.

**K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis Projects:**
- Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm and applied to perform image compression.
- Used Principal Component Analysis to find low-dimensional representations of face images.

**Logistic Regression Project:**
- Predicted whether or not a student gets admitted into a university using Logistic Regression on data from two tests.
- 89% accuracy

**Neural Networks and Backpropagation Projects**
- Implemented a Neural Network and performed Backpropagation on the network
- 97.18% accuracy on the training set

**One-vs-All Logistic Regression and Neural Networks Project:**
- Implemented One-vs-All Logistic Regression and Neural Networks to recognize handwritten digits.
- 95.14% accuracy on the training set

**Regularized Linear Regression Project:**
- Implemented Regularized Linear Regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

**Single Variable and Multivariable Linear Regression Projects:**
- Predicted profits for a food truck in certain cities using Linear Regression with One Variable
- Predicted housing prices in Portland, Oregon based on the size of the house, # of bedrooms, and prices of other houses in the area using Multivariable Linear Regression

**Support Vector Machine Spam Classification Project:**
- Implemented a SVM model to build a spam classifier
- 99.83% accuracy on the training set, 98.60% accuracy on test set
