# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning-Projects

Below are the descriptions of each project and what I have done in each project.  Feel free to take a look around!


## Udemy:

**ANN's (Artificial Neural Networks):**
- Used a subset of the LendingClub dataset from Kaggle to build a Sequential Deep Learning Neural Network model that can predict whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan based on historical data on loans.
- 0.89 F1 Score with an imbalanced dataset (80% paid off, 20% defaulted)
---------
- Used a Sequential Deep Learning Neural Network to predict housing prices in Kings County, USA based on other houses in the area from a Kaggle dataset.
- Explained Variance Score of 0.795

**Decision Trees and Random Forest Project:**
- Used a LendingClub dataset of loans to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full using Decision Tree and Random Forest Models from sklearn
- Decision Tree Model has a 0.74 F1 Score
- Random Forest Model has a 0.85 F1 Score

**Deep Learning:**
- Used a Bank Authentication dataset from the UCI repository.
- Trained a DNNClassifier from Tensorflow with a 0.86 F1 Score
- Compared with a trained Random Forest classifier that achieved a 0.99 F1 Score

**Support Vector Machines:**
- Used the famous Iris flower data set (Fisher's Iris dataset)
- Trained an SVM model with a 0.89 F1 Score
- Used GridSearch to fit a grid model on the dataset and improved my previous SVM model to an F1 Score of 0.93

**K-Means Clustering:**
- Used K Means clustering to cluster Universities into two groups - Private and Public
- Achieved an F1 Score of 0.78 considering the algorithm is purely using the features to cluster the universities into 2 distinct groups

**K-Nearest Neighbors:**
- Used K-Nearest Neighbors to try and predict a target class given a random dataset.
- Achieved an F1 Score of 0.83

**Natural Language Processing:**
- Classifed Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews using a Yelp Review Dataset from Kaggle
- Trained a Naive Bayes model to predict the number of stars with a 0.93 F1 Score
- Used a pipeline with TF-IDF to achieve the same (0.93) F1 Score on the same data.

**Logistic Regression:**
- Used an advertising dataset indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an advertisement.
- Created a Logistic Regression model that will predict whether or not they will clock on an ad based off the features of that user.
- Achieved an F1 Score of 0.91

**Linear Regression:**
- Used Linear Regression to decide if an ecommerce company based in NYC should focus their efforts on their app experience or website.
- Achieved an Explained Variance Score of 0.98

## Other Projects:

I have a few projects in here that I did not mention in this README.  These projects were simply done to learn more about NumPy, Principal Component Analysis, Pandas, Python, and data visualization tools such as MatPlotLib and Seaborn.


## Coursera:

**Support Vector Machine Spam Classification Project:**
- Implemented a SVM model to build a spam classifier
- 99.83% accuracy on the training set, 98.60% accuracy on test set

**Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems Projects:**
- Implemented an anomaly detection algorithm and apply it to detect failing servers on a network.
- Used collaborative filtering to build a recommender system for recommending movies based on past ratings and data.

**K-Means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis Projects:**
- Implemented K-Means clustering algorithm and applied to perform image compression.
- Used Principal Component Analysis to find low-dimensional representations of face images.

**Neural Networks and Backpropagation Projects**
- Implemented a Neural Network and performed Backpropagation on the network
- 97.18% accuracy on the training set

**One-vs-All Logistic Regression and Neural Networks Project:**
- Implemented One-vs-All Logistic Regression and Neural Networks to recognize handwritten digits.
- 95.14% accuracy on the training set

**Logistic Regression Project:**
- Predicted whether or not a student gets admitted into a university using Logistic Regression on data from two tests.
- 89% accuracy on the training set

**Regularized Linear Regression Project:**
- Implemented Regularized Linear Regression to predict the amount of water flowing out of a dam using the change of water level in a reservoir.

**Single Variable and Multivariable Linear Regression Projects:**
- Predicted profits for a food truck in certain cities using Linear Regression with One Variable
- Predicted housing prices in Portland, Oregon based on the size of the house, # of bedrooms, and prices of other houses in the area using Multivariable Linear Regression
